# Project Structure
The project is organized into a clear folder and file structure, isolating each module. Below is a proposed directory layout:

```
project_root/
├── main.py                   # Entry point to launch the application
├── config.yaml               # Configuration file (e.g., thresholds, camera ID, etc.)
├── requirements.txt          # Python dependencies (Flask/FastAPI, OpenCV, YOLO, etc.)
├── managers/
│   ├── camera_manager.py     # CameraManager class
│   ├── detection_manager.py  # DetectionManager class
│   ├── dashboard_manager.py  # DashboardManager class
│   ├── api_manager.py        # APIManager class (defines API endpoints)
│   ├── database_manager.py   # DatabaseManager class
│   └── resource_provider.py  # ResourceProvider class for config and logging
├── static/
│   └── test_page.html        # Basic HTML page(s) for testing (served by APIManager)
└── logs/
    └── app.log               # Log file for structured logs (if file logging is used)
```

## Directory Explanation:
- **main.py:** Orchestrates the initialization of all managers and starts the system. It loads configuration, starts threads, and runs the web server.
config.yaml: Stores configuration values such as camera index, resolution, detection thresholds, idle and active frame rates, etc. This allows tweaking system behavior without code changes. (Alternatively, a JSON or Python config dictionary could be used.)
- **requirements.txt:** Lists required Python packages (e.g., opencv-python, ultralytics for YOLOv8, Flask or FastAPI, etc.), ensuring the environment on the Pi has all dependencies.
- **managers/:** This directory contains one module per manager class. Each file defines a manager class responsible for one aspect of the system’s functionality. Keeping them separate enforces modularity.
    - camera_manager.py: Handles video capture using OpenCV or PiCamera, runs the capture loop in a thread.
    - detection_manager.py: Loads the YOLOv8 model and runs inference in a loop, managing detection frequency and tracking.
    - dashboard_manager.py: Tracks analytics (counts, timestamps, etc.) and can compile simple reports or status summaries.
    - api_manager.py: Sets up the Flask/FastAPI application, defines API endpoints (and maybe serves the static test HTML).
    - database_manager.py: Encapsulates all database interactions (initializing SQLite tables, inserting events, querying data).
    - resource_provider.py: Manages configuration loading and logger setup. It might also provide shared objects (like a centralized logger or config accessible to all managers).
- **static/:** Contains static files to be served by the API, such as a basic test_page.html to verify the video and detection pipeline. (For example, this page could use JavaScript to periodically query the API for status or display a snapshot image.)
- **logs/:** Directory for log files (if file logging is enabled). All modules can log to a common file (through ResourceProvider’s logger configuration) with structured entries (timestamp, module, severity, message).

This structure ensures a clear separation: each manager’s code is in its own module, configuration is externalized, and runtime artifacts (logs, etc.) are kept in their own places. The separation will make it easier to maintain or extend each part (for instance, adding a new manager or replacing the detection algorithm) without affecting others.
