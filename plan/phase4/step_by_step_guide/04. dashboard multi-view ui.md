# Dashboard Multi-View UI – Phase 4

With multiple cameras streaming, the dashboard (HTML interface) should display all active feeds. In **Phase 4**, we'll implement a basic two-camera view on the dashboard for testing, arranged in a grid. Each feed will be shown in real-time via the existing MJPEG mechanism. We'll also make minimal adjustments to indicate which camera is which and prepare the UI for future advanced analytics displays.

## Multi-Camera Video Layout

Update the frontend HTML (e.g., `static/test_page.html`) to display two camera feeds:

```html
<div class="card">
  <h3>Live Camera Feeds</h3>
  <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; flex-wrap: wrap;">
    <!-- Camera 0 Feed -->
    <div style="position: relative; margin: 10px;">
      <img id="camera-feed-0" src="/video_feed/0" width="320" height="240" alt="Camera 0 Feed">
      <p style="text-align:center; font-weight: bold;">Camera 0</p>
      <canvas id="roi-canvas-0" width="320" height="240" style="position:absolute; top:0; left:0;"></canvas>
    </div>

    <!-- Camera 1 Feed -->
    <div style="position: relative; margin: 10px;">
      <img id="camera-feed-1" src="/video_feed/1" width="320" height="240" alt="Camera 1 Feed">
      <p style="text-align:center; font-weight: bold;">Camera 1</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

- Uses `flex-wrap: wrap` for responsiveness.
- Canvas overlay is maintained for Camera 0 only.
- Labels identify each camera.

## ROI Drawing for Multiple Feeds

Currently, the ROI overlay is supported for **Camera 0 only**. For now:

- The existing ROI canvas and controls (Save/Reset) apply to Camera 0.
- Label the section clearly, e.g., “Configure ROI for Camera 0”.
- Extending ROI to other cameras (via UI) is planned for future phases.

> Backend already supports per-camera ROI, so UI enhancements later are feasible.

## Basic Analytics Display (Placeholder)

You can include a metrics summary section like this:

```html
<div class="card">
  <h3>Camera Comparison</h3>
  <div id="comparison-metrics">Loading comparison...</div>
</div>
```

In a script, fetch from the backend:

```javascript
fetch('/api/analytics/compare')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    const output = Object.entries(data)
      .map(([cam, count]) => `Camera ${cam}: ${count} entries today`)
      .join('<br>');
    document.getElementById('comparison-metrics').innerHTML = output;
  });
```

> Keep it simple — display text or raw JSON. Interactive charts can be implemented in later phases.

## Testing the Multi-View Dashboard

### Checklist:

- **Simultaneous Streams**: Open dashboard in browser and verify both `/video_feed/0` and `/video_feed/1` stream correctly.
- **Identify Feeds**: Check labels match the actual camera/video content.
- **ROI Functionality**: Draw ROI on Camera 0 and save/reset as before. Verify feed 1 is unaffected.
- **Analytics**: Confirm `/api/analytics/compare` populates the placeholder section with sample data.

---

## Future Enhancements (UI)

Planned upgrades for future phases:

- Add UI controls for adding/removing cameras via form.
- Allow ROI drawing on any selected camera.
- Integrate analytics charts (e.g., time-series, heatmaps).
- Improve layout scaling (auto grid, fullscreen view, etc.).

## \sequentialthinking Subtasks Outline:

1. **Modify HTML for Multi-Feed**  
   Update the dashboard HTML with two `<img>` tags for separate camera feeds, placed inside a flex container. Assign distinct IDs (e.g., `camera-feed-0`, `camera-feed-1`).

2. **Label Feeds**  
   Add visible labels like "Camera 0", "Camera 1" under each feed for easy identification.

3. **Adapt ROI Overlay**  
   Keep ROI canvas functionality for Camera 0 only. Clarify in the UI that ROI applies to Camera 0. No need to implement camera selection logic yet.

4. **Include Analytics Section (Optional)**  
   Add a "Camera Comparison" section in HTML. Use JavaScript to call `/api/analytics/compare` and display results. Keep it minimal (text or JSON output).

5. **Update Frontend JS**  
   Ensure ROI and status-related scripts still function for Camera 0. Avoid breaking existing logic. If needed, duplicate logic for other feeds.

6. **Manual Testing in Browser**  
   Start the backend with two cameras. Open the updated dashboard and verify:
   - Both feeds stream in real-time.
   - ROI drawing and saving on Camera 0 works.
   - Analytics metrics (if shown) reflect actual data or dummy counts.
   - Layout adapts on small screens and doesn’t break existing UI components.
