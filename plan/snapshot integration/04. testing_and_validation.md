# Task
Test snapshot functionality thoroughly to ensure snapshots are:

Correctly captured at the start and end of detections.

Properly deleted in FIFO manner when exceeding the storage limit.

Correctly logged in the database (if database enhancement applied).

# Testing Steps:
Trigger multiple detection events (entry and exit).

Verify that snapshots appear in the snapshots folder with correct filenames.

Set a small max_files (e.g., 10-20) temporarily to quickly test FIFO behavior.

Confirm older snapshots are deleted automatically.

Check database entries (if integrated) for correct snapshot_path fields.
