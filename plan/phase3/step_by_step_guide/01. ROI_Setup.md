# ROI Setup - Phase 3

Phase 3 will enhance the detection pipeline to confine person detection to a configured Region of Interest (ROI) and interpret the tracked direction as an entry or exit event based on user configuration. We need to modify the detection logic to only count people within the ROI (near a door) and map their travel direction to entry/exit footfall events. These changes must be integrated without disrupting the existing detection flow or performance.

---

## Extend DetectionManager for ROI

Introduce new attributes in `DetectionManager` to hold the ROI and the entry/exit direction mapping for each camera. For example, add:

- `self.roi_coords` — tuple of (x1, y1, x2, y2)
- `self.entry_direction` — string/flag indicating which direction is considered "entry" (e.g., `"LTR"` or `"RTL"`)

Initialize these to `None` or defaults. Load these settings at startup (e.g., from the database or config — see ROI Persistence step). If no ROI is configured, `self.roi_coords` remains `None`, and detection proceeds on the full frame as before.

---

## Integrate ROI Cropping in Detection Loop

Update the person detection logic to filter detections by ROI. After YOLO detects a person’s bounding box, ensure the person is within the defined ROI before treating it as a valid detection.

```python
for box in boxes:
    cls_id = int(box.cls[0])
    if cls_id == self.person_class_id:
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = box.xyxy[0]  # bounding box coordinates
        if self.roi_coords:
            # Only consider person if within ROI
            rx1, ry1, rx2, ry2 = self.roi_coords
            center_x = (x1 + x2) / 2
            center_y = (y1 + y2) / 2
            if not (rx1 <= center_x <= rx2 and ry1 <= center_y <= ry2):
                continue  # Skip: outside ROI
        person_detected = True
        person_bbox = (x1, y1, x2, y2)
        break  # Found a person in ROI
```

If no person is detected in the ROI, the loop behaves as if no person is present — ensures counting is limited to doorway traffic. If no ROI is set, the extra check is skipped, preserving performance.

---

## Maintain Direction Tracking

Keep the existing direction logic intact (`position_history`, `direction_threshold`). Since we now ignore people outside the ROI, direction detection is naturally limited to movements through the ROI (e.g., doorway).

---

## Map Direction to Entry/Exit Events

When a detection session ends (i.e., person no longer detected after a few frames):

- Check `self.current_direction`.
- Use `self.entry_direction` mapping:
  - If `entry_direction = "LTR"` and `current_direction = DIRECTION_LEFT_TO_RIGHT` → **entry**
  - If `current_direction = DIRECTION_RIGHT_TO_LEFT` → **exit**
  - Vice versa if `entry_direction = "RTL"`

Example pseudocode at detection end:

```python
if self.person_detected and not person_detected_now:
    self.person_detected = False
    direction_str = self._direction_to_string(self.current_direction)  # e.g. "left_to_right"

    if self.entry_direction:
        if direction_str == "left_to_right":
            event_type = "entry" if self.entry_direction == "LTR" else "exit"
        elif direction_str == "right_to_left":
            event_type = "entry" if self.entry_direction == "RTL" else "exit"
        else:
            event_type = "unknown"
    else:
        event_type = "unknown"

    self.logger.info(f"Footfall event: {event_type} (direction={direction_str})")

    if self.db_manager:
        self.db_manager.log_detection_event(event_type, direction=direction_str)
    if self.dashboard_manager:
        self.dashboard_manager.record_footfall(event_type)
```

Emit a socket event for frontend if needed.

---

## Backward Compatibility

If no ROI or direction mapping is configured:

- `self.roi_coords = None` → skip ROI filtering
- `self.entry_direction = None` → skip entry/exit classification, log generic detection

Use conditional checks to ensure new features are **opt-in** and existing logic remains unaffected.

## \sequentialthinking Subtasks Outline:

1. Add ROI coordinate and `entry_direction` attributes to `DetectionManager`, and ensure they can be updated (e.g., via a setter or on init).
2. Modify the detection loop to include an ROI check when deciding if a person is detected.
3. Implement logic to handle detection end events: determine entry/exit based on direction and mapping.
4. Update `DashboardManager` and `DatabaseManager` interfaces to handle the new entry/exit event types (increment counters, log to DB). (This will be detailed in later steps.)
5. Test with ROI unset and with a dummy ROI to verify that detection triggers only inside the ROI and that entry/exit events are classified correctly.
