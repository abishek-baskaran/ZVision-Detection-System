Now we ensure the analytics and dashboard data are fully accurate and any incomplete parts are implemented:

- Implement _process_detection_events: Currently this method is a stub in DashboardManager. Its purpose is likely to monitor changes in detection state and update metrics accordingly (especially to mark the end of a detection session). We should complete this:

    - Track the transition from “person present” to “person absent.” For example, maintain last_status.person_detected. Each time through the monitor loop, if previously True and now False, that means a person just left the frame. We can then update the detection_history deque’s last event duration and possibly log a “detection ended” event.

    - Similarly, if previously False and now True, that’s a detection start (which we already handle via record_detection(), but the monitor could double-check).

    - We might decide to remove the monitor thread entirely and rely on direct calls from DetectionManager (since DetectionManager already calls record_detection() on start and the database logs on end). However, for completeness, implement it to update the last detection event’s duration field: e.g., find the last entry in detection_history where "duration": 0 (a placeholder set in record_direction when a detection is ongoing) and set its duration to now - last_detection_time when the person disappears.

    - Pseudocode in _process_detection_events:
```
# if person was detected and now not detected:
if last_status["person_detected"] and not current_status["person_detected"]:
    # Person left the frame
    with self.metrics_lock:
        # update last detection duration
        if self.detection_history:
            last_event = self.detection_history[-1]
            if last_event["duration"] == 0:  # if still open
                last_event["duration"] = time.time() - last_event["timestamp"]
        self.logger.info("Dashboard: person left, duration updated.")
```
This way, get_recent_detections() will show how long the last person was present (if needed). This is an enhancement for completeness; even if not critical for basic functionality, it aligns with tracking footfall events.

- Verify metric calculations: Ensure DashboardManager.get_total_metrics() and get_hourly_metrics() use the updated counters. Currently get_total_metrics() returns the detection_count and direction_counts, which should correctly represent total footfall count and direction breakdown since startup. The database is also logging each detection event; we could cross-verify if needed (or even compute totals from DB for persistence, but in-memory is fine for live display).

- Footfall Count: The footfall count can be interpreted as the number of unique detection events (people appearances). We use detection_count for this (incremented on each detection start). This number is shown in the metrics card as “Total Detections.” If we want to be explicit, we can label it as “Footfall count” on the front-end. (Simply change the text in the HTML from "Total Detections" to "Footfall Count" if desired.)

- Dashboard Data Reset or Persistence: Since the system might run indefinitely, consider whether to reset counts periodically or persist some metrics:
    - We might use the database to aggregate long-term stats (e.g., daily counts). The function DatabaseManager.get_detection_count_by_direction(days=7) exists to query how many detections ended in the last N days by direction. If needed, expose an API for such historical metrics. This is optional, but good for future expansion (like showing a “last 7 days footfall” chart).
    - The current approach with hourly_stats in DashboardManager covers hourly breakdown since the app started. This is fine for a live dashboard; just be aware if the app restarts, those reset (which is acceptable).
- Integrate DashboardManager with DatabaseManager (if needed): They operate in parallel now (DashboardManager for live stats, DatabaseManager for permanent log). This duplication is okay. We should ensure that all key events are recorded in the database:
    - Detection start and end events: Already logged via DatabaseManager.log_detection_event() in DetectionManager when a person appears or disappears.
    - Direction changes: Also logged (event_type="direction" with direction value).
    - Therefore, the database’s detection_events table will have a history of all detection sessions and direction determinations. The dashboard can always query this via the /api/detections/recent endpoint (already implemented) to show, for example, the last N detection events, which could be displayed in the UI if desired (e.g., a list of recent timestamps and directions).
    
By completing the dashboard manager logic and verifying metrics, we ensure the analytics (person count, direction counts, last seen times) are accurate and robust. This addresses any remaining inconsistencies between the implementation and the desired analytics.
