Most required API endpoints are already present, but let’s double-check and extend if necessary so the frontend has all data it needs without direct database access:

- Status & Metrics: /api/status already combines system status, current detection state, and a summary of metrics. This is used for the “System Status” card. Ensure we include the new detection_active flag here (as noted in Step 2) so the UI knows if detection is paused.

- Toggle Endpoints: We added /api/detection/start and /api/detection/stop in Step 2.

- Video Feed: We added /video_feed in Step 1 (note: this is not under /api prefix since it returns a streaming response, which is fine).

- Recent Detections: /api/detections/recent returns a list of recent detection events (by default 10) from the DB. We might use this to populate a log on the page (optional). If we want an in-memory source, DashboardManager.get_recent_detections() provides a similar list from detection_history.

- Events: /api/events returns general events (if any other events logged via log_event). This might include system start/stop or other debug logs. It’s not critical for the dashboard, more for debugging.

- Settings: /api/settings returns the configuration (used for debugging; not necessarily shown on UI).

- Additional Analytics: If needed, we could add an endpoint for the get_detection_count_by_direction query (to get cumulative counts over days). For instance, /api/metrics/summary?days=7. This would query the DB for detection_end events in the last N days. This is a “nice-to-have” if long-term analytics are needed on the web UI (not explicitly requested, so optional).

At this stage, the backend API should be feature-complete: it supports starting/stopping detection, providing the live video, and exposing all relevant stats.
