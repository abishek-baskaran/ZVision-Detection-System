We will allow the user to turn the person detection on or off from the dashboard. This conserves resources when detection is not needed and gives control for maintenance or demo purposes.

- Backend API Endpoints: Add two new endpoints in APIManager for toggling detection:
    - POST /api/detection/stop – to pause detection.
    - POST /api/detection/start – to resume detection.

Inside these routes, simply call the corresponding methods of DetectionManager:
```
@self.app.route('/api/detection/stop', methods=['POST'])
def stop_detection():
    try:
        self.detection_manager.stop()  # stop the detection thread
        return jsonify({"message": "Detection stopped", "active": False})
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"Error stopping detection: {e}")
        return jsonify({"error": str(e)}), 500

@self.app.route('/api/detection/start', methods=['POST'])
def start_detection():
    try:
        self.detection_manager.start()  # restart the detection thread
        return jsonify({"message": "Detection started", "active": True})
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"Error starting detection: {e}")
        return jsonify({"error": str(e)}), 500
```
These assume that calling start() after a stop will spawn a new thread as designed (the current DetectionManager.start() handles the case if already running). We also return a JSON indicating the new state (active True/False).

- Handling Detection State: When detection is stopped, the DetectionManager.is_running flag becomes False and the thread ends. We should define how this reflects in system status:
    - In DetectionManager.stop(), after setting is_running=False, consider resetting some state: e.g., you might set person_detected = False and current_direction = DIRECTION_UNKNOWN (with appropriate locking) to indicate no active detection. This ensures that get_detection_status() doesn’t report “person_detected=True” from a stale last frame after stopping.

    - The /api/status endpoint can also include a flag like "detection_active": False if detection is paused. You can derive this from DetectionManager.is_running. This helps the frontend know the system is in idle state intentionally.

- Frontend Controls: Add a toggle button to the HTML page to call these endpoints:
    - For example, add a button <button id="toggle-detect">Pause Detection</button> in the controls section.
    - In the DOMContentLoaded script, attach a click handler:
```
let detectionOn = true;
document.getElementById('toggle-detect').addEventListener('click', () => {
  const url = detectionOn ? '/api/detection/stop' : '/api/detection/start';
  fetch(url, { method: 'POST' })
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => {
      if (data.error) {
        alert("Failed to toggle detection: " + data.error);
        return;
      }
      detectionOn = !detectionOn;
      // Update button text and status display
      document.getElementById('toggle-detect').innerText = detectionOn ? 'Pause Detection' : 'Resume Detection';
      // Optionally, update status indicator on UI to show detection is off
    });
});
```
Initially detectionOn is true (since detection starts active). When clicked, it sends a POST to stop, then flips state and updates the button text to "Resume Detection". The next click will do the opposite.
    - Visual feedback: When detection is off, you might gray out the “Person Detected” indicator or add a note in the status card (e.g., show “Detection: Off” in the System Status). This can be done by adjusting the updateStatus() function to check a detection_active flag from /api/status. For example, if data.detection_active is false, you can display all detection-related info as “(paused)” or similar.
- Concurrency: Stopping detection will terminate the detection thread loop. This should free up CPU for the camera stream. Ensure that toggling rapidly (on/off) doesn’t create multiple threads – the DetectionManager.start() should handle not starting if already running (it does log a warning if so). Our endpoint should only call start if we know it was stopped. Using the detectionOn flag on the frontend and perhaps checking detection_manager.is_running on the backend before starting helps maintain consistency.

- Edge Cases: If a person was present when detection was stopped, the last status might linger. By resetting person_detected to False on stop, we treat it as if the scene is clear once paused. When resuming, the system will start fresh (it will detect again on the next frame if a person is indeed still there). This is acceptable for our use-case.

With this feature, the user can pause the heavy YOLO processing when needed (the camera stream will still run), and resume it to continue detecting people.
