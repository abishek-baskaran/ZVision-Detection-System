To make the dashboard truly real-time and reduce the reliance on polling, consider integrating WebSockets for instantaneous updates. This will allow the server to push events (like “person detected” or new counts) to the browser the moment they happen.

- Integrate Flask-SocketIO: Add flask_socketio to the project (include in requirements.txt). Initialize it in the APIManager or main app:
```
from flask_socketio import SocketIO
# ... in APIManager __init__ or in main after creating Flask app:
self.socketio = SocketIO(self.app, cors_allowed_origins="*")
```
(If doing this in APIManager, store socketio as an attribute, and call socketio.run(app, ...) instead of app.run() in the start() method of APIManager.)
Emit events from DetectionManager: Whenever a significant event occurs, emit a WebSocket message:
  - On person detection start (in DetectionManager._detect_and_track, when you switch to active mode), emit something like:
```
if self.dashboard_manager:
    self.dashboard_manager.record_detection()
if self.api_manager and hasattr(self.api_manager, 'socketio'):
    self.api_manager.socketio.emit('detection_start', {
        'timestamp': now, 
        'message': 'Person detected'
    })
```
Similarly, emit a detection_end event when a person is lost (after no_person_counter triggers the switch to idle), and a direction event when direction is determined:
```
self.api_manager.socketio.emit('direction', { 'direction': direction_str })
```
The data can include any info you want to display.
  - You may need to pass the api_manager (or at least its socketio instance) to the DetectionManager. This could be done by storing a reference or by having a global socketio. Alternatively, DashboardManager could emit events (since it also has access to detection status changes via the monitor thread). Choose a convenient place to call socketio.emit when state changes.
- Client-side WebSocket handling: Include the Socket.IO client script in the HTML:
```
<script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
<script>
  const socket = io();  // auto-connect to the same host
  socket.on('detection_start', data => {
    // Update the status indicator to "Yes (person detected)"
    // maybe flash a highlight or update last detection time
    updateStatus();  // or directly manipulate DOM to reflect new status
  });
  socket.on('detection_end', data => {
    // Update status to "No (no person)" and perhaps update metrics
    updateStatus();
  });
  socket.on('direction', data => {
    // data.direction is "left_to_right" or "right_to_left"
    // Update the direction display and increment the corresponding count in UI
    updateMetrics();
  });
</script>
```
In a simple implementation, you might still call the existing updateStatus() and updateMetrics() functions to re-fetch the latest data when an event occurs (this avoids duplicating logic to update DOM). This hybrid approach greatly reduces latency (events trigger immediate refresh instead of waiting for the next interval).

- Adjust polling strategy: With WebSockets in place, you can reduce or eliminate the fixed interval polling. For example, you might stop the 5-second interval for status/metrics updates, and instead only fetch on these socket events (and maybe keep a slower heartbeat update for redundancy). The video stream is unaffected by this (it’s already streaming continuously).

- Fallback to AJAX: If WebSockets fail or are not used (perhaps due to resource constraints or simplicity), ensure the AJAX polling is frequent enough to capture events. You could, for instance, poll every 1 second when person_detected is true (to catch direction changes promptly), and every 5 seconds when idle (to save bandwidth). This adaptive polling can be done by checking the last status each time. WebSockets, however, are the cleaner solution for real-time updates​.

- Resource Consideration: The SocketIO server will run on the Pi; use a lightweight async server (Flask-SocketIO defaults to using eventlet or gevent). The combination of streaming video + SocketIO on a Raspberry Pi is borderline but should be acceptable on Pi 5 (which is quite powerful). Test the performance; if the Pi struggles with both, you can choose to use only one (e.g., keep video streaming via MJPEG and use polling for stats, or vice versa). In practice, the data messages are tiny compared to video frames, so they shouldn’t add much load.

Implementing WebSockets is optional but recommended for the best UX. It ensures the dashboard instantly reflects detection events (minimal delay), and it can simplify the client code by removing constant polling.
