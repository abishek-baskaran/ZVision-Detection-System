With all backend features in place, we must ensure the single-page dashboard is fully functional and user-friendly:

- HTML Structure: Keep it to one HTML file (for easy deployment). Ensure it links to any external scripts (like SocketIO) if needed.
- Video Feed Display: Confirm that the <img src="/video_feed"> is showing the live stream. It should reflect near-real-time video. Style the video element with a fixed size or max-width as needed.
- Controls: We now have two buttons: e.g., “Refresh” (if still kept) and “Pause/Resume Detection”. Consider combining or repurposing the refresh button:
    - Since we have auto-updates, a manual refresh might not be needed. You could remove it or use it as a fallback in case something stalls.
    - Alternatively, use that space for a “Toggle Camera” if you had multiple camera sources or other controls.
- Status Indicators: Use colored dots or text to indicate system status. For example, a green dot for “Detection On” vs red for “Detection Off” in the status card. The sample HTML/CSS already includes .status-indicator classes for active/inactive statuses. Update the logic in updateStatus() to reflect the detection active state:
```
HTML += '<p><strong>Detection Status:</strong> ';
if (data.system && data.system.status === 'running' && data.detection_active !== false) {
    statusHTML += '<span class="status-indicator status-active"></span>Active';
} else {
    statusHTML += '<span class="status-indicator status-inactive"></span>Paused';
}
statusHTML += '</p>';
```
And then show “Person Detected: Yes/No” as already done (but maybe not at all if detection is paused).
- Real-Time Data Binding: If using WebSockets, the UI should update upon events (as discussed in Step 5). If not using them, the setInterval polling (or a modified version of it) remains in place. Make sure to clear any duplicate intervals if the page is loaded multiple times or if you switch to event-driven updates to avoid unnecessary network calls.
- Display Additional Info: Optionally, show the footfall count and direction counts on the page in a clearer way:
    - The “Detection Metrics” card currently lists total detections and direction counts. This covers footfall (total) and how many went left vs right. You can enhance formatting (maybe highlight the most frequent direction, etc.) or add a timestamp of last update.
    - You could also display the last N detection events (from /api/detections/recent) in a small table: e.g., a list of entries like “2025-03-27 15:14:00 – left_to_right”. This gives an idea of recent activity. This is extra, but the data is available via API.
- Testing on different devices: Ensure the page works on mobile and desktop (basic HTML should). The stream might be intensive for mobile browsers, but as long as it loads, it’s fine.

After this step, the frontend should seamlessly show live video, continuously updating stats, and allow the user to control the detection. The page should not require manual refresh at all during normal operation.
