- Create managers/dashboard_manager.py and implement DashboardManager:
    - Initialize counters and possibly timestamps. Use a threading.Lock to guard these shared variables.
    - Implement record_detection() to increment the detection count and update last_detection_time.
    - Implement record_direction(direction) to update the count for that direction and record last_direction.
    - Implement get_summary() to return the collected stats.
    - This component is simpler to test: you can simulate calls to record_detection and record_direction and then call get_summary() to see if the counts match. Also, verify thread safety by code review (actual concurrent testing is tricky, but the lock usage should suffice).
    - This manager doesn’t have its own thread; it’s a passive data holder. It will be called from DetectionManager’s thread and read from the API thread.
