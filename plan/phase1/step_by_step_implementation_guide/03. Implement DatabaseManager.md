- Create managers/database_manager.py and implement DatabaseManager:
    - In __init__, connect to the SQLite database file and call a method to create tables if they don’t exist. Use a lock (threading.Lock) to ensure thread safety of the connection.
    - Implement _create_tables() to create an events table as described. You can expand the schema if desired (for example, add columns for specific info like direction or use separate tables for different event types later).
    - Implement log_event(event_type, data) to insert a new record. Test that inserting works by calling it directly after initialization (maybe in a test routine, insert a test event and query it).
    - Implement get_events(limit) to fetch recent events. This will be used later by the API to display events.
    - Make sure to handle closing the connection on program exit (you might rely on Python’s garbage collection or explicitly close it in your main shutdown routine).
    - Test the DatabaseManager separately: call log_event with a sample event and then get_events to verify it returns the event. For example:
```
db = DatabaseManager(rp)
db.log_event("test_event", {"foo": "bar"})
print(db.get_events(1))
```
This should show the event with type "test_event" and the JSON data.
