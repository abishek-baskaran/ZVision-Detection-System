- Create the project directory and subfolders as described in the Project Structure. Initialize a Python virtual environment on the Raspberry Pi 5 and install required libraries:
    - OpenCV for video capture (opencv-python).
    - Ultralytics YOLOv8 (ultralytics package) or an alternative YOLOv8 implementation.
    - Flask (or FastAPI plus Uvicorn) for the API.
    - PyYAML for config parsing, and possibly sqlite3 (comes with Python standard library).

- Create a config.yaml file with initial settings. For example:
```
camera_index: 0        # default camera
frame_width: 640
frame_height: 480
idle_interval: 1.0     # 1 second between detections when idle
active_interval: 0.2   # 0.2s between detections (~5 FPS) when active
confidence_threshold: 0.5
yolo_model_path: "yolov8n.pt"   # path to YOLOv8 model weights
host: "0.0.0.0"
port: 5000
log_level: "INFO"
```
Adjust values as needed (for instance, a higher confidence_threshold might reduce false positives).
- Write a basic requirements.txt with the libraries and their versions that are known to work on Pi 5. Install them.
