- Create managers/api_manager.py and implement APIManager:
    - Initialize Flask app and define the routes as per the pseudocode. Use send_from_directory to serve the test HTML page from the static folder.
    - Create a static/test_page.html. This can be very simple at first, e.g.:
```
html
Copy
Edit
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html><body>
  <h1>System Status</h1>
  <div id="status">Loading...</div>
  <script>
    async function fetchStatus() {
      const res = await fetch('/status');
      const data = await res.json();
      document.getElementById('status').innerText = 
        `Person present: ${data.person_present}, ` +
        `Direction: ${data.current_direction}, ` +
        `Total detections: ${data.total_detections}`;
    }
    setInterval(fetchStatus, 1000);
    fetchStatus();
  </script>
</body></html>
```
This script fetches the status every second and displays it. (This is just for testing; in real use a more polished UI or real-time feed might be used.)
    - The /events route can output raw JSON; you might not use it on the test page but itâ€™s useful to verify events via browser or curl.
    - Consider enabling CORS if you plan to query from a different origin (not needed if you access directly).
    - Test APIManager separately by running the Flask app without the other components (you can instantiate APIManager with some dummy managers or with parts of them). Check that you can retrieve the static page and that the endpoints return data (you might hard-code some dummy data in the dummy managers for this test).
    - Make sure to set debug=False or use_reloader=False when running on the Pi to avoid multiple threads issues with reloader.
