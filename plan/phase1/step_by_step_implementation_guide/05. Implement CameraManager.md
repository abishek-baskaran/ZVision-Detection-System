- Create managers/camera_manager.py and implement CameraManager as per the skeleton:
    - Initialize the camera using OpenCV. If you are using the Raspberry Pi camera module, ensure OpenCV is configured to use it, or consider using the picamera2 library. For simplicity, OpenCV VideoCapture with index 0 should work if the camera is properly set up.
    - Implement the _capture_loop to continuously read frames. Use the queue to store frames. The queue dropping logic is important to avoid blocking: if put_nowait fails due to full queue, catch the exception or check queue.full() and pop one as shown. This ensures the queue never blocks the camera thread (which could cause frame drops at the capture side).
    - Implement start() to launch the thread and stop() to signal it. The thread should run as daemon.
    - Test CameraManager independently on the Pi hardware: Write a small script to start CameraManager and then in a loop call frame = cam.frame_queue.get(timeout=1) and display it using OpenCV (cv2.imshow) or simply count frames to ensure frames are coming. This test ensures the camera is accessible and the threading works. (Be sure to handle a quit condition in such a test to stop the thread gracefully.)
    - If not using a physical display, you could just count frames or write one to disk to confirm it's capturing.
