- If you need to handle multiple people simultaneously, consider integrating a tracking algorithm like Deep SORT or OpenCV’s multi-object trackers. Deep SORT would involve extracting feature embeddings for each detected person and matching them across frames【】【】, which might be heavy for the Pi but could be tried with optimizations. Alternatively, a simpler approach is to track multiple centroids and use a distance threshold to match them frame-to-frame (a basic centroid tracker).
- If the Pi 5 supports hardware acceleration (like a GPU or the Neural Processing Unit in the Pi’s SoC), leverage it. For instance, use OpenCV’s DNN with OpenVINO or TensorRT for YOLO, or use Coral USB accelerator with a TFLite model for person detection to offload CPU.
- Add more API endpoints as needed: e.g., an endpoint to fetch the current video frame with bounding boxes drawn (you could have DetectionManager store the last frame with detections annotated, and serve it as an image via Flask). This would help in verifying what the model sees. Keep such endpoints optional to not overload the Pi (drawing boxes and encoding images to JPEG can be done at a lower frequency).
- Implement configuration for choosing threading vs multiprocessing. The current design uses threads. If CPU becomes a bottleneck (for example, if detection is so heavy that it slows down the Flask responses), you could run DetectionManager in a separate process. That would require using multiprocessing to fork a process and communicate frames/results via shared memory or a socket. The architecture can accommodate this (CameraManager could send frames via a multiprocessing Queue, and DetectionManager process sends back events or flags). This is an advanced change, but the modular separation makes it easier to contain such changes within the Camera/Detection managers.
- Expand DashboardManager to perhaps periodically dump stats to the database or reset counts daily, etc., if long-running.
- Add authentication or security in APIManager if the system will be accessible in a sensitive environment (Flask can be behind a simple auth or run in a network-isolated environment as needed).
