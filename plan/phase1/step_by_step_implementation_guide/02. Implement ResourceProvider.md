- Create managers/resource_provider.py and implement the ResourceProvider class as sketched above. Focus on:
    - Loading the config file (use yaml.safe_load or json if using JSON).
    - Setting up the logging format. Make sure the log directory exists (create logs/ if not present to avoid errors when adding a FileHandler).
    - Test this module in isolation: write a short snippet (in a Python REPL or a quick test file) to instantiate ResourceProvider and retrieve some config values to ensure file reading works. Also, test that logging works (e.g., logger = rp.get_logger("Test"); logger.info("Test message") should print with the correct format and also write to logs/app.log).
