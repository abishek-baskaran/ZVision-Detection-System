**Purpose:** The DatabaseManager provides a simple interface to a SQLite database for storing and retrieving persistent data. Even though the system can function without a DB (just using in-memory stats), using SQLite allows us to keep a record of events that survive restarts and can be analyzed later (e.g., how many people were detected over a week, at what times, etc.). Additionally, if more features are added (user management, calibration data, etc.), the database layer is already in place. 

### Responsibilities:
- Initialize a SQLite database file (e.g., app.db) and ensure required tables exist (for example, a table for detection events).
- Provide functions to insert events (e.g., log_event(event_type, data) as used by DetectionManager).
- Provide query functions for retrieving events or stats (e.g., get all events in a time range, or counts by type).
- Handle thread-safety for database operations. SQLite allows multiple readers and one writer at a time per connection. We might use a single connection with a lock, or use the sqlite3 module’s ability to be accessed from multiple threads (SQLite in Python by default is single-threaded unless check_same_thread=False when connecting). For simplicity, using a lock around DB operations or opening a new connection for each operation (since writes are infrequent) can be done.

### Pseudocode Skeleton:

```
# managers/database_manager.py
import sqlite3
import threading
import os

class DatabaseManager:
    def __init__(self, resource_provider):
        self.logger = resource_provider.get_logger("DatabaseManager")
        db_path = resource_provider.get_config("db_path", "app.db")
        # Ensure database file and connection
        self.conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path, check_same_thread=False)
        self.conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row  # for dict-like cursor results
        self._lock = threading.Lock()
        # Initialize tables if not exist
        self._create_tables()

    def _create_tables(self):
        with self._lock:
            cursor = self.conn.cursor()
            # Example events table: id, timestamp, type, json_data
            cursor.execute("""
                CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS events (
                    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
                    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
                    type TEXT,
                    data TEXT
                )
            """)
            self.conn.commit()
        self.logger.info("Database tables ensured.")

    def log_event(self, event_type: str, data: dict):
        """Insert a new event record (event_type with associated data)."""
        with self._lock:
            cursor = self.conn.cursor()
            # Store data as JSON string or key=value; here we do JSON for flexibility
            import json
            data_str = json.dumps(data)
            cursor.execute("INSERT INTO events (type, data) VALUES (?, ?)", (event_type, data_str))
            self.conn.commit()
        self.logger.debug(f"Logged event: {event_type} -> {data}")

    def get_events(self, limit: int = 100):
        """Retrieve recent events for debugging or analysis."""
        with self._lock:
            cursor = self.conn.cursor()
            cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM events ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT ?", (limit,))
            rows = cursor.fetchall()
        # Convert rows to list of dicts
        events = []
        for row in rows:
            events.append({
                "id": row["id"],
                "timestamp": row["timestamp"],
                "type": row["type"],
                "data": row["data"]
            })
        return events

    def close(self):
        """Close the database connection."""
        self.conn.close()
```

**Explanation:** In DatabaseManager.__init__, we open a SQLite connection. We set check_same_thread=False so that we can use this connection from multiple threads (our CameraManager/DetectionManager threads might call log_event while APIManager might call get_events). We still use a threading.Lock to serialize DB operations to avoid SQLite’s concurrent write issues. _create_tables() ensures the events table exists. We define log_event(type, data) to insert an event; the data is stored as a JSON string for flexibility (it could contain arbitrary info like direction, or time if we want to specify a custom time instead of default). The get_events method is an example to fetch recent events, which could be used by an API endpoint to show a log of detections (helpful for testing or basic monitoring). 

This database schema is minimal. The events table can record any type of event (person appeared, disappeared, direction, etc.) along with a timestamp. For a more structured approach, we could have separate tables for “detections” or “directions” but this general events table keeps it simple and flexible. It can be extended or normalized in the future if needed.
