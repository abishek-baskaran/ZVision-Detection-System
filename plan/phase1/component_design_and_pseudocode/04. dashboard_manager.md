**Purpose:** The DashboardManager accumulates analytics data and provides an interface to retrieve it for display. In this context, “analytics tracking” can include things like total number of people detected, counts of movements in each direction, or timestamps of last events. The DashboardManager essentially acts as an in-memory aggregator and live summary of the system’s detection activities. 

### Responsibilities:
- Maintain counters or logs for key metrics, such as:
    - Total persons detected (or total detection events).
    - Count of directions: how many moved left vs right.
    - Timestamp of last detection or last direction change.
- Provide methods for other components (especially DetectionManager) to update these metrics whenever an event occurs (e.g., record_detection(), record_direction(direction)).
- Provide methods for APIManager to retrieve current metrics or generate a simple dashboard view (e.g., get_summary() returning all current stats in a dict).
- Optionally, if the data needs to be persistent or more detailed, DashboardManager could also interface with DatabaseManager to query historical data (for example, to get today’s count from the events table). But primarily, it will handle quick in-memory stats for the live dashboard.

### Pseudocode Skeleton:

```
# managers/dashboard_manager.py
import threading

class DashboardManager:
    def __init__(self, resource_provider):
        self.logger = resource_provider.get_logger("DashboardManager")
        # Analytics data (protected by a lock for thread safety)
        self._lock = threading.Lock()
        self.total_detections = 0
        self.direction_counts = {"left": 0, "right": 0}
        self.last_detection_time = None
        self.last_direction = None

    def record_detection(self):
        """Call when a person is detected (appearance)."""
        with self._lock:
            self.total_detections += 1
            self.last_detection_time = __import__("time").time()
        self.logger.info(f"Total detections incremented: {self.total_detections}")

    def record_direction(self, direction: str):
        """Call when a direction of movement is determined."""
        with self._lock:
            if direction in self.direction_counts:
                self.direction_counts[direction] += 1
            else:
                self.direction_counts[direction] = 1
            self.last_direction = direction
        self.logger.info(f"Recorded direction: {direction}")

    def get_summary(self):
        """Get a summary of current stats (for API or dashboard display)."""
        with self._lock:
            return {
                "total_detections": self.total_detections,
                "direction_counts": self.direction_counts.copy(),
                "last_detection_time": self.last_detection_time,
                "last_direction": self.last_direction
            }
```

**Explanation:** The DashboardManager keeps track of some counters and last-seen values. We use a threading.Lock to ensure that if the DetectionManager thread calls record_detection or record_direction while at the same time the APIManager thread calls get_summary, we don’t get a race condition or inconsistent read. The record_detection() method is intended to be called when a new person appearance is detected (in DetectionManager._detection_loop, we call dashboard.record_detection() when a person is first detected). Similarly, record_direction(direction) is called when a movement direction is determined. We log these events and update counters. The get_summary() method returns a snapshot of all relevant metrics; it copies the direction_counts dictionary to avoid the risk of it changing while being used elsewhere. 

In a more complex system, DashboardManager might also compute rates (e.g., detections per minute) or handle multiple cameras’ data. It might even push updates to a front-end via websockets for a real-time dashboard. In our design, we keep it simple: the API will pull data from DashboardManager on request and present it.
