**Purpose:** The APIManager sets up the RESTful API server that allows external clients (or a web frontend) to interact with the system. It defines endpoints for retrieving status and metrics, and for serving a basic dashboard/test page. We can use Flask (for simplicity) or FastAPI (for a more feature-rich async framework). Here, we outline using Flask with simple routes, as it’s sufficient for a Raspberry Pi deployment and easy to understand. The APIManager integrates other managers by calling their methods to get data or trigger actions. 

### Responsibilities:
- Initialize the web framework (Flask app). Configure it to serve static files (like the test HTML) if needed.
- Define API endpoints:
    - e.g., GET /status – returns the current status (person present or not, current direction, etc., likely using DetectionManager.get_status() and DashboardManager.get_summary()).
    - GET /events – returns recent events from the database (using DatabaseManager.get_events()).
    - GET /dashboard or root (/) – returns an HTML page that perhaps includes a simple dashboard or instructions. This page might use AJAX to hit the other API endpoints.
    - Optionally, endpoints to start/stop detection or adjust settings (for future extension).
- Run the Flask development server (or Uvicorn if FastAPI) on the Pi, listening for requests. (In production you might use gunicorn, but for testing and development, running directly is fine.)
- Ensure that starting the API server does not block the other threads. (In our design, we will start the API in the main thread after starting camera/detection threads. Flask’s built-in server will handle requests on separate threads, so it should work concurrently with our background threads.)

### Pseudocode Skeleton:
```
# managers/api_manager.py
from flask import Flask, jsonify, send_from_directory, render_template_string

class APIManager:
    def __init__(self, resource_provider, camera_manager, detection_manager, dashboard_manager, db_manager):
        self.config = resource_provider
        self.camera = camera_manager
        self.detection = detection_manager
        self.dashboard = dashboard_manager
        self.db = db_manager
        self.logger = resource_provider.get_logger("APIManager")
        self.app = Flask(__name__, static_folder="static", static_url_path="/static")
        self._define_routes()

    def _define_routes(self):
        # Health check or simple index
        @self.app.route("/")
        def index():
            # Serve a basic HTML page for testing (could also use an actual template file)
            return send_from_directory('static', 'test_page.html')

        @self.app.route("/status")
        def status():
            # Combine detection status and dashboard summary into one response
            status = self.detection.get_status()
            summary = self.dashboard.get_summary()
            return jsonify({
                "person_present": status["person_present"],
                "current_direction": status["current_direction"],
                "total_detections": summary["total_detections"],
                "direction_counts": summary["direction_counts"],
                "last_detection_time": summary["last_detection_time"],
                "last_direction": summary["last_direction"]
            })

        @self.app.route("/events")
        def events():
            events = self.db.get_events(limit=50)
            return jsonify(events)

        # (Additional endpoints can be added here, e.g., to manually trigger camera, etc.)

    def run(self):
        host = self.config.get_config("host", "0.0.0.0")
        port = self.config.get_config("port", 5000)
        debug = self.config.get_config("debug", False)
        self.logger.info(f"Starting API server at http://{host}:{port}")
        # Running Flask server (will block this thread, but our main thread will call this last)
        self.app.run(host=host, port=port, debug=debug, use_reloader=False)
```

**Explanation:** In APIManager.__init__, we create a Flask app, pointing it to serve static files from the static/ directory. The _define_routes method uses Flask’s decorator syntax to define three routes:

- / (index) serves the test_page.html from the static folder. (Alternatively, one could use render_template if using Jinja templates, or even just render_template_string as shown for quick inline HTML. Here we use send_from_directory to send a pre-made HTML file.)
- /status returns a JSON of the current system status by combining data from DetectionManager and DashboardManager. This is useful for a front-end or for testing the system’s state via an API client.
- /events returns recent logged events from the database in JSON format, which can help in debugging or verifying that events (appearances, disappearances, directions) are being recorded.

We might create a simple test_page.html that uses JavaScript to hit the /status endpoint every second and display the results (e.g., “Person present: Yes/No, Direction: Left/Right, Total count: X”). This page can be opened in a browser to observe the system working in real-time. 

The run() method starts the Flask server. We use use_reloader=False to avoid the server starting twice (since we likely will run this in a script, not via flask run). We retrieve host/port from config; typically on a Pi you might use 0.0.0.0 to allow external access. The API runs in the main thread – once called, it will handle incoming requests (Flask by default spawns a new thread per request). Our detection and camera threads are already running in background, so they will continue working and updating states while the API responds to calls.
