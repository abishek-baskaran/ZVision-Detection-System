**Purpose:** The CameraManager is responsible for interfacing with the camera hardware (or video source) and capturing frames continuously. It runs as a background thread so that frame capture is non-blocking to the main program. It ensures the latest frame is always ready for the DetectionManager, and implements any necessary frame rate control or frame dropping logic to avoid overwhelming the system. 

### Responsibilities:
- Initialize the camera (e.g., using OpenCV’s cv2.VideoCapture with the device index or a PiCamera library if using Raspberry Pi’s camera module).
- Continuously capture frames in a dedicated thread.
- Store or enqueue frames for consumption by the DetectionManager. Use a thread-safe mechanism (like a queue.Queue) to hand off frames.
- Handle camera resource cleanup on shutdown (release the camera device).
- Potentially manage camera settings (resolution, frame rate) based on config.

### Pseudocode Skeleton:

```
# managers/camera_manager.py
import cv2
import threading
import queue

class CameraManager:
    def __init__(self, resource_provider):
        config = resource_provider
        self.camera_index = config.get_config("camera_index", 0)
        self.frame_width = config.get_config("frame_width", 640)
        self.frame_height = config.get_config("frame_height", 480)
        self.capture = cv2.VideoCapture(self.camera_index)
        # (Optional: set resolution on capture if supported)
        self.capture.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH, self.frame_width)
        self.capture.set(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_HEIGHT, self.frame_height)
        self.frame_queue = queue.Queue(maxsize=1)  # will hold the latest frame
        self._stop_event = threading.Event()
        self.logger = resource_provider.get_logger("CameraManager")

    def start(self):
        """Start the camera capture thread."""
        self.logger.info("Starting CameraManager thread...")
        self._stop_event.clear()
        threading.Thread(target=self._capture_loop, daemon=True).start()

    def _capture_loop(self):
        """Internal method: continuously capture frames and put into queue."""
        while not self._stop_event.is_set():
            ret, frame = self.capture.read()
            if not ret:
                self.logger.warning("Camera frame read failed")
                continue
            # If queue is full, remove the oldest frame to make space (to avoid blocking)
            if self.frame_queue.full():
                try:
                    self.frame_queue.get_nowait()  # drop the old frame
                except queue.Empty:
                    pass
            # Put the latest frame in the queue
            try:
                self.frame_queue.put_nowait(frame)
            except queue.Full:
                pass  # If it's somehow still full, skip frame
        self.capture.release()
        self.logger.info("Camera capture stopped.")

    def get_frame(self):
        """Get the most recent frame (without removing it)."""
        # We can peek at the queue; if empty, return None
        if self.frame_queue.empty():
            return None
        return self.frame_queue.queue[-1]  # get last item without removing

    def stop(self):
        """Signal the capture loop to stop."""
        self._stop_event.set()
```

**Explanation:** The CameraManager uses OpenCV to capture frames. In _capture_loop, it reads frames in a tight loop. We use a queue.Queue(maxsize=1) as a circular buffer for frames – if a new frame comes in and the queue is full (i.e., an old frame hasn’t been consumed yet), we drop the old frame to always keep only the freshest frame. This ensures the DetectionManager always works on the latest frame and the system doesn’t pile up backlog, preventing memory bloat and lag. The thread runs as daemon so it will not block program exit. The start() method launches the thread, and stop() will signal the loop to break (cleanly releasing the camera). We also included a simple get_frame() method in case other components (like APIManager) need to fetch a frame (e.g., to serve an image snapshot); it simply returns the newest frame in the queue without removing it (peek). Logging is used to record events like thread start/stop and any frame read issues.
