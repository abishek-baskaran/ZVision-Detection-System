**Purpose:** The ResourceProvider centralizes configuration and logging for the application. It loads configuration settings (from a YAML/JSON file or environment variables) and sets up a structured logging system that all other managers can use. This avoids duplication of config parsing and ensures consistent logging format across modules. 

### Responsibilities:

- Load configuration values such as camera parameters, detection thresholds, frame rates, etc., at startup. Provide an easy interface (e.g. get("param_name")) for other components to retrieve config values.
- Initialize Pythonâ€™s logging module with a structured format (including timestamps, module name, log level). Optionally, configure log output to a file (e.g., logs/app.log) for persistence.
- Provide a logger instance to other classes (could be the root logger or each class gets its own named logger via logging.getLogger(component_name)).

### Pseudocode Skeleton:

```
# managers/resource_provider.py
import logging
import yaml  # assuming YAML config; could use json or configparser as needed

class ResourceProvider:
    def __init__(self, config_file: str = "config.yaml"):
        # Load configuration from file
        with open(config_file, 'r') as f:
            self.config = yaml.safe_load(f)
        # Structured logging setup
        log_level = self.config.get("log_level", "INFO")
        log_format = "%(asctime)s [%(name)s] %(levelname)s: %(message)s"
        logging.basicConfig(level=log_level, format=log_format,
                            handlers=[logging.StreamHandler()])
        # Optionally add FileHandler for logs/app.log
        file_handler = logging.FileHandler("logs/app.log")
        file_handler.setFormatter(logging.Formatter(log_format))
        logging.getLogger().addHandler(file_handler)
        logging.getLogger().setLevel(log_level)
        # Now logging is configured globally; individual managers can get their own logger.

    def get_config(self, key: str, default=None):
        """Retrieve a configuration value."""
        return self.config.get(key, default)

    def get_logger(self, name: str):
        """Get a logger for a given module name."""
        return logging.getLogger(name)
```

**Explanation:** In the above skeleton, ResourceProvider loads a YAML config (this file would contain keys like camera_index, idle_detection_interval, etc.). It then configures logging: we set a format that includes timestamp, logger name (module), and message, which yields structured logs. By adding both a console handler and a file handler, logs will be visible on the console and saved to a file. Other managers can call provider.get_logger("CameraManager") to get a logger and then use logger.info(), logger.error(), etc., with the unified format. This class could also handle any other shared resources (for example, if in the future we have a singleton object like a thread pool, it could reside here).
